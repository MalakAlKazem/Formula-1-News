after the race, Tsunoda said: “I don’t even want to talk about it to be honest. “We were fighting outside of the points anyway, P13/14, and I was just overtaking Magnussen, I was side by side, and then we swapped the cars in the last few laps. To be honest, I can’t understand. We have to review… In the end, [Daniel] didn’t overtake as well so… whatever.” Carlos Sainz may have already lost his Ferrari seat for next season, but the Spaniard wasted no time in showing the Scuderia what they'll be missing as he beat team mate Charles Leclerc
