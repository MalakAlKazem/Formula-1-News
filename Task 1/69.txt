rules cycle an abject misery but Hamilton believes the team finally “have a North Star” that he will hope can yield a return towards the form that delivered eight constructors’ championship on the bounce from 2014. I expect Hamilton, who will start the first of a new two-year deal next season, to revel in a car that the team hope is more driveable, predictable and – more importantly – faster. While a championship fight is almost certainly out of the question, that kind of step should end his two-year absence for a victory. Aston Martin will win a Grand Prix.
