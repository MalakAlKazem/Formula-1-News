able to deliver a strong final stint, which was a good reference for Zhou’s tyre management. Even in these difficult conditions, we played as a team. I want to pay tribute to the team: after yesterday’s difficult qualifying, which did not reflect where we think we are in terms of overall performance, we made an improvement today, also thanks to both drivers’ performances. We now need to focus on the next step: we know the areas of our car we need to improve: if we keep working like we did in the last few weeks, there will be opportunities soon.”
